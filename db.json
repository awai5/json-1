Flutter supports its through StatefulWidget.\napp state − Last for entire application like logged in user details, cart information, etc., Flutter supports its through scoped_model.",

It requests the server and collects the response back in async/await pattern. For example, the below code reads the data from the specified url and print it in the console",
